PDF Parser by Taylor Young

This is a node application that is used for converting information in PDFs to CSV.

It is currently set for our team's specific invoicing needs, but can easily be amended to find information in any PDF.

In order to run locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

2. Make sure all of the individual PDFs that you want to convert are in the /pdfs directory of this project.

3. Make sure both the /csv and the /json directories are empty.

4. Make sure node is installed by running node -v
  -if not, install it here https://nodejs.org/en/download/

5. run 'node checkCount.js'
  -make sure this outputs the correct number of pdfs

6. run 'node readPdfDirectory.js'
  -this reads the /pdfs directory and iterates through each pdf
  -for each pdf it utilizes the PDFParser library from 'pdf2json' (https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf2json)
  -then it uses Node's 'fs' library to write to the /json directory the newly created json files

7. run 'node checkCount.js'
  -make sure the /json directory now contains the same number of files as the /pdfs directory

8. run 'node transformJSON.js'
  -this iterates through the /json directory
  -for each json file, the content is passed to the findData function, which finds all of our relevant data
    -findData is the function you would alter if you were ever to need to customize the information you need from the PDF files/ json data
  -then the data from each json file is added to an array called csvData
  -csvData is passed to the createCSV function which utilizes the npm package 'convert-array-to-csv' and writes the csv to the /csv directory
9. Open the CSV and do your manual double checking
